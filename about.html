            <h2>About</h2>
            <span>Isaac Iverson, 1 May 2019</span>
            <p>
                There are a handful of presuppositions in my worldview which I consciously hold to be true — and a sparse few that I
                allow undying influential say in my life and work. Those sparse few presuppositions have come to inform every part of my
                being, and can only be found in what I think is best described as God’s Love Letter to Humanity — the Bible.
            </p>
            <p>
                For instance, I believe that human beings were created by a living and active God. I also believe that as His final
                creative work, His crowning achievement, we motley mankind were endowed by Him with His image and granted with the
                ability and responsibility to truth-tell and to create. I believe that because of this vivid and inborn image, each
                person is born with unimaginable value, dignity, and worth. I believe that because of His infinitely unconditional love
                for every human being, His son chose to become one of us, to live the life that was required of us, to die the death
                that we deserved, in order to repair the relationship between Him and us that has been marred since Adam.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is what I hold to be true.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is what I consciously allow to influence my life and my work.
            </p>
            <p>
                But it shouldn’t stop there. I think that Stephen Fry put it best when he wrote, “a true thing, poorly expressed, is a
                lie.”
            </p>
            <p>
                As a fellow image-bearer, I have the responsibility to tell you the truth in the most richly expressive way that I can.
                As one who has been adopted by God because of my faith in His Son, it is my duty to express truths about Him through my
                every action. I will fail at this, but I will not stop trying.
            </p>
            <p>
                All of my creative work is to be a reflection of His creativity. All of my labor is to be worked and completed as if I
                am working directly for Him.
            </p>
            <p>
                All glory be to Christ.
            </p>
