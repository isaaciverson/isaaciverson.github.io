            <h1>Why Do We Trust So Easily?</h1>
            <h2>Isayah Ramirez</h2>
            <p>I was on the train heading back to my college campus after a much-needed break with my family. As the train hummed along
            and the snow gently trickled down, I began to reflect on the notion of trust. To elaborate, I am no wise sage who sits
            and ponders life’s most profound mysteries. Recently one of my professors assigned a project where we have to display
            what we believe trust to be. Being tasked with the incoming assignment and staring dramatically out of the window, as if
            in a 2000’s music video, I had to come up with something. The thought process towards the project immediately began at
            discussing trust falls, because that’s an easy thing to envision. The longer I entertained the idea of trust falls, the
            more I began to realize that trust is a lot more complicated than I initially thought. It started with the question,
            “when did I learn how to trust?” There’s no tutorial on how to trust, and I don’t remember there being a day where my
            trust began. It’s reasonable to assume that we are born trusting. Every action and decision we make, there is a
            dimension of trust we are channeling. The next question was answered before I even asked, “why do we trust so easily?”
            Trust is so vital to our everyday life because we are continually using our trust to decide whether or not to depend on
            something. Using the example of a chair, every day we make the unconscious decision to trust that the seats we take will
            be able to hold our weight and it does, even in the circumstance that we take a seat and the chair breaks, we would find
            another seat to take that one’s place. We trust so easily because we’ve always done it. That is the conclusion that I
            reached. Smiling satisfied with the philosophical ideas I came up with the peace within my mind immediately rushed into
            chaos as more questions began to develop. If we trust so easily, then how did we learn how distrust works? Who teaches
            how to undo trust? If trust is lost how are we able to teach ourselves to trust again? At this point, I recognized that
            I was way over my head with this thinking process. I may have been confused by trust as a whole, but I still understood
            a few things. Trust is very complex, yet we are born doing it and without it, we would die. We all trust so easily
            because we are designed to depend on trust in order to live.</p>
