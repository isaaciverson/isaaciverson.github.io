            <h1>A Glance at Trust Through Christian Media</h1>
            <h2>Isayah Ramirez</h2>
            <p>I’m not entirely sure if I am the only person who does this but moving forward I am just going to assume that I’m not.
            So the other day I was listening to a mix of songs that I put together to listen to while in the shower. Normally I
            listen to pop songs and piece together a concert performance where yours truly is the star, but this day I felt a level
            of conviction towards the music I spend the majority of the time listening to. I decided to switch it up and play some
            Christian music from an artist that I really have enjoyed recently by the name of Montell Fish. As the songs began to
            play one track, in particular, caused my concert to stop and be in awe of who God is. The track was called “Heavenly
            Father,” and in all honesty, there is nothing complex going on in the song, the chorus is “you are my Heavenly Father
            and I ain’t gotta worry about a thing.” This chorus is a simple truth, that if we trust God, everything else falls in
            line. That is the common thing I believe that runs throughout Christian media. Trusting in God results in the resolution
            of what is troubling us. However, instead of saying this outright, Christian media would rather refer to this truth as
            getting out of a storm, dessert, or deep waters. Nonetheless, trusting in God always results in the same way, the
            abandonment of control over a situation and leaving it entirely to God. Even the simplicity of the theme of trust in
            Christian media is mind-blowing. The only reason trusting God is difficult is because we make it difficult. While the
            song was playing I began to cry with the acknowledgment that I make things harder than they have to be because although
            it is straight forward, relinquishing control is difficult. I guess that is just the beauty of Christ captured by some
            media. In order to gain control we must first surrender all control to God.</p>
